- DiscordGo (https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)
    - pros:
        * By far the most popular binding (1.1k stars on github)
        * Has a pretty big userbase 
    - cons:
        * As said in the README: "This library and the Discord API are unfinished. Because of that there may be major changes to library in the future.", but that basically applies to every lib

- DisGord (https://github.com/andersfylling/disgord)
    - pros:
        * Looks ok
    - cons:
        * Not as popular as DiscordGo
